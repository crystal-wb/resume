                <p>Hello, it&rsquo;s nice to meet you. I&rsquo;m Crystal Janeen Williams-Brown and I am an artist/programmer/gamer. My life&rsquo;s journey is a bit of a strange one, so on paper I don&rsquo;t come across well. But in person you can see how all the seemingly random bits of my experience have coalesced into a capable, funny, friendly and kind human being. There have been many challenges, miserable circumstances, and heart breaks. However, I don&rsquo;t regret any of it. I am grateful for both the pain and joy that has made me who I am. I have a saying, &ldquo;Like flowers, people need both sunshine and rain to grow.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Okay, enough of that dreary stuff. I am obsessed with video games. Oh, that segway doesn&rsquo;t make sense? Well that&rsquo;s how I talk. My friends used to make a game out of mapping my train of thought. Even I find it difficult to follow at times, still it&rsquo;s never boring. Besides my entire life is made of weird segwways. Anyway, video games have been a part of my life for a very long time. My mom would get me to behave in school by granting or taking away my privilege to play games. At the time I didn&rsquo;t even have my own game platform to play on, I would play at her best friend&rsquo;s house (which was also the home of my best friend-talk about kismet) and during the summer I could play my cousin&rsquo;s consoles. I didn&rsquo;t get my own until I was heading towards middle school. That is when I got my first Gameboy. I seriously slept next to it every night. Later I saved up any money I got until I could finally buy an Xbox in high school along with a Nintendo 64. The most money and time I have ever spent has been on video games and computers (which I upgraded so I could play better video games).</p>
                <p>Despite this love, I thought I was too dumb to learn programing. Even after doing really well in a computer repair class, I thought creating the content I loved so much was out of my reach. This is because I was told I was dumb from elementary school through high school. I was placed in special classes and made fun of regularly. At the time I had no idea that my learning style was just different. It wasn&rsquo;t until college (which I only attended for my mom&rsquo;s sake) that I began to see how smart I could be. I went from a C being a high grade for me to getting A&rsquo;s and A+&rsquo;s constantly. I graduated from Wake Tech with a 3.9, which shocked me. Still I would only look at the students taking programing courses and talk to them about the courses with envy, while avoiding taking a single programming class myself. My classes where all humanities focused, so I thought I was only smart when it came to studying people or sciences such a biology and geology (I&rsquo;ve been in love with rocks since I was little, mostly because they allow me to see the &lsquo;code&rsquo; that things are made of).</p>
                <p>Though I had at last discovered I could be smart, I hadn&rsquo;t figured out what to do with my intelligence. After some stressful, shady and miserable jobs I ended up applying to an art school (University of North Carolina School of the Arts, specifically)-since I knew I loved art. There my friends dragged me to an animation club where I instantly fell in love with the concept of making something from nothing. It was tedious, difficult and exhausting. Yet, I didn&rsquo;t want to stop doing it. All my friends quit the club but I remained and joined the animation program. However, as I went deeper into animation I realized something was still missing. I couldn&rsquo;t put my finger on it. After graduating I struggled to find work, all the while feeling like working for an animation studio wasn&rsquo;t quite right for me. Then I hit the hardest time of my life: I had no money, I went through hurricane Sandy (I&rsquo;m from the Jersey Shore), my mom lost her home, and I got extremely ill but couldnâ€™t afford a doctor. During all that games gave me hope/strength.</p>
                <p>I began to think of how I used to make up video game stories and decided to see if I could get hired by one of my favorite game companies, Mad Head Games, to write stories. They didn&rsquo;t have an opening but they did have an extremely kind HR person by the name of Tamara Milenkovic who helped guide me into studying game design. I decided to give it a shot since I had nothing to lose. I took story classes on Coursera (with a scholarship because that was the only way I could afford to do so). Then I started playing around with Unity 3D after watching some Markiplier let&rsquo;s plays of games created on that engine by people who taught themselves to code. Things clicked. I took a few classes in programming with C# and realized I wanted to know more code, but I also wanted a teacher I could actually talk to if I needed to (one of the downsides of Coursera). The Iron Yard was too expensive but one of their employees (Stacey Vernon) told me about Code The Dream. Now that I&rsquo;m in the Code The Dream Ruby program I feel like I at last have a sense of where I belong. I am a builder. All my varied experiences allow me to create diverse content. And my strange brain allows me to see the end at the beginning. That&rsquo;s why I speak in a odd way and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m good at what I do. I wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way.</p>
                <p>Thank you for taking the time to read all this!</p>
                <p>Sincerely, Crystal</p>
